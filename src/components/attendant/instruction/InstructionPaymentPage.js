                    A show-up payment of $5 is given to all participants irrespective of their performance in the experimental task. Moreover, you can earn a significant amount of money from the task (up to $100 AUD) if you perform well, but payments will also be varying considerably across participants. To be more specific, if you play optimally, you will be mostly likely to leave the lab with more than $80 AUD, and even highly likely to get the max payment of $100. However, if you do not implement the optimal strategy for the task, your most likely payoff from the task will be $0 AUD, which means that you will leave the lab with only the show up payment of $5 AUD.
