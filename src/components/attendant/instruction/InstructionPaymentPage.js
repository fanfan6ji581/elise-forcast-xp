                    The computer records your outcome on each trial and randomly selects {xpConfig.percentageEarning}% of the trials
                    at the end of the experiment.
                    Your net accumulated outcomes in these trials define your earnings (i.e., the money you will receive from us).
                    If your final earnings are below $5 AUD, you will get $10 AUD ($5 AUD show-up reward and $5 AUD participation reward).

                    If you fail to reply within the allowed time, this is a missed and you will lose $1 AUD.

                    You can earn a significant amount of money from the task (up to ${xpConfig.treatment === 1 ? 150 : 100} AUD)
                    if you perform well, but payments will also be varying considerably across participants. To be more specific,
                    if you play optimally, you will be mostly likely to leave the lab with more than ${xpConfig.treatment === 1 ? 130 : 80} AUD,
                    and even highly likely to get the max payment of ${xpConfig.treatment === 1 ? 150 : 100} AUD.
                    However, if you do not implement the optimal strategy for the task, your most likely payoff from the task will be $5 AUD.
