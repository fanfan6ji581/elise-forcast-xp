                There are two types of switches. Some of the switches are "<b>regime shifts</b>": they usually last for several days, as shown in the picture. Others are <b>"aberrations"</b>: the value switches back immediately (see for example, trial 18).

                  We are showing you this because your job is to <b>forecast</b> in real time on each of {xpConfig.numberOfTrials} trials
                  whether a switch is going to occur over the next day, and <b>there is a pattern linking the volume indicator to the regime shifts.</b>

                  <br />
                  <br />
                  What that means is that if you manage to identify what the pattern is, you may be able to track the value
                  of the volume indicator to forecast the regime shift and to improve your performance.
