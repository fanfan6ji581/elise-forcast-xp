                  We are showing you this because your job is to <b>forecast</b> in real time on each of {xpConfig.numberOfTrials} trials
                  whether a switch is going to occur over the next day, and <b>there is a pattern linking the volume indicator to the regime shifts.</b>

                  <br />
                  If you manage to identify what the pattern is, you may track the value of the volume indicator to forecast the regime shifts by differentiating them from aberrations, which can greatly improve your performance.

              The Pattern
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="h6" sx={{ my: 5 }}>
              Here is the pattern linking the volume indicator to the regime shifts: when volume departs from
              its baseline value (0), this signals that <Typography display="inline" variant="span" sx={{ color: 'error.main' }}>a regime shift is going to occur sometime in the coming
                trials</Typography>, i.e., the player enters <Typography display="inline" sx={{ color: 'error.main' }} fontSize={28}>"the dangerous zone"</Typography>.
            </Typography>
          </Grid>

          <Grid container alignItems="" sx={{ my: 5 }}>
            <Grid item xs={6} sx={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
              <Box component="img" alt="" src={image6} sx={{ boxShadow: 0, width: '100%' }} />
            </Grid>
            <Grid item xs={6}>
              <Typography variant="h6" sx={{ my: 5, ml: 5 }}>
                In this example, you can see that the volume variable departs from its baseline value at Trial 6:
                this is the first trial in <Typography display="inline" sx={{ color: 'error.main' }} fontSize={20}>the dangerous zone</Typography>.
              </Typography>
              <Typography variant="h6" sx={{ my: 5, ml: 5 }}>
                You can see the shift occurs at Trial 10: the value shifts to High, and the volume indicator reverts to its baseline value, which means that it is no longer in the dangerous zone.
              </Typography>
            </Grid>
          </Grid>

          <Divider />

          <Grid container alignItems="center" sx={{ my: 5 }}>
            <Grid item xs={6} sx={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
              <Box component="img" alt="" src={image7} sx={{ boxShadow: 0, width: '100%' }} />

            <Grid item xs={6}>
              <Typography variant="h6" sx={{ my: 5, ml: 5 }}>
                The volume indicator thus allows you to tell when a switch is an aberration vs. a regime shift.
              </Typography>
              <Typography variant="h6" sx={{ my: 5, ml: 5 }}>
                For example here, at Trial 18, the value has switched but the volume indicator is at its baseline value.
                This is an aberration and the value immediately switches back to its previous value (here, Low) at Trial 19.
              </Typography>
              <Typography variant="h6" sx={{ my: 5, ml: 5 }}>
                In contrast, at Trial 12 a regime shift occurs (after 2 trials in the dangerous zone: Trials 10-11).

            <Typography variant="h6">
              The probability of a regime shift while in the dangerous zone is constant.
              The probability of an aberration while outside the dangerous zone is constant too.
              This means that the two probabilities are fixed and they do not change during the task depending on how you play.
